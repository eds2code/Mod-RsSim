# Mod-RsSim
A modbus serial and TCP simulator I wrote and shared decades ago, it still gets used, but has some minor Windows 10 issues (requires elevation).

This simulator's source was originally published on codeguru.com in (https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/i-n/network/serialcommunications/article.php/c5401/MODBUS-Serial-RTU--TCPIP-Simulator.htm)
I then copied and published it to codeproject (todo reference here)
In 2006 I relocated to the UK, rebooted my life, and published a binary copy on a proper website http://www.plcsimulator.org. I get intermittent downloads and roughly enough donations, to cover the hosting ever since.
Due to inactivity, someone has forked the project (todo reference here)
It remained untouched between 2006 and 2017. But recently have become convinced that git is the future and probably the only way to resurrect this tool without having to do loads of re-testing myself since I no longer have the needed equipment to verify really well. But I also want to keep the source open in spirit, (it is released under GPL3, and I have some contribs to merge in, and I even know of a fork made.) Even if the code quality is not great, it still fits the line of:

If this code works I wrote it. If it crashes, then it's probably someone else's fault.
