# Mod-RsSim
A modbus serial and TCP simulator I wrote and shared decades ago, it still gets used, but has some minor Windows 10 issues.

This simalator's source was origionally published on codeguru.com in (todo reference here)
I then coppied and published it to codeproject (todo reference here)
In 2006 I relocated, and published a binary copy on a proper website http://www.plcsimulator.org. I get intermittent downloads and roughly enough donations, to cover the hosting ever since.
It remained untouched between 2006 and 2017. But recently have become convinced that git is the future and probably the only way to resurrect this tool without having to do loads of re-testing myself since I no longer have the needed equipment to verify really well. but also keep the source open in spirit, even if the code quality is not great, it still fits the line of:

If this code works I wrote it. If it crashes, then it's probably someone else's fault.
